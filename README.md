# Housing-Prices
Compare different algorithms on housing prices regression problem on the basis of cross validation score

1. Normal Equation
2. Batch Gradient Descent (self created implementation)
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent
4. Ridge Regression
5. Lasso Regression
6. Elastic Net
7. SVM
8. Decision Trees

Finally I test them against a Random Forest Classifier which is an ensemble, to show their effectiveness.
